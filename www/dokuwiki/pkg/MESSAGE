Dokuwiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

  * quick setup / single wiki

With Apache, this directory must be granted at least with this:
	AllowOverride Limit

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
	ln -s ../dokuwiki /var/www/htdocs/dokuwiki

Then add to your httpd.conf:
	<Directory /var/www/dokuwiki>
		AllowOverride Limit
	</Directory>

Proceed to complete the installation by opening install.php in your browser.
If you are upgrading your installation, don't forget to remove install.php.


  * symlink farm

You can find documentation on http://www.dokuwiki.org/tips:symlink_farm
File inc/preload.php define DOKU_CONF, patch from port.
File conf/dokuwiki.php configure savedir correctly, path from port.

For apache it looks like this :

	mkdir -p /var/www/htdocs/dokuwiki && cd /var/www/htdocs/dokuwiki
	cp -pr ${INSTDIR}/{data,conf,.htaccess.dist} .
	# reference some additional files (msg for correct handling of upgrade
	# notifications and the standard config files)
	ln -sf ../../../dokuwiki/conf/dokuwiki.php conf/.
	ln -sf ../../../dokuwiki/conf/{acl.auth,local,users.auth}.php.dist conf/.
	# www is the web server user
	chown -R www:www data/ conf/
	# link require file
	ln -s ../../dokuwiki/{install.php,index.php,doku.php,feed.php,inc,lib} .

Don't forget to configure your vhost/directory as describe before.
Finish your installation with install.php and remove the link.


  * note about plugin manager

For security reason we remove write access for www in plugins directory.
In order to work, the plugin manager need write access to ${INSTDIR}/lib/plugins :

	chown www ${INSTDIR}/lib/plugins
