About
OpenDNSSEC was created as an open-source turn-key solution for DNSSEC. It
secures zone data just before it is published in an authoritative name server.

Why DNSSEC?
Many internet protocol hinge on DNS, but the data in DNS caches has become so
vulnerable to attack that it cannot be relied upon anymore. The added
authenticity in DNSSEC makes sure that such attacks have no effect.

What does OpenDNSSEC do?
OpenDNSSEC takes in unsigned zones, adds the signatures and other records for
DNSSEC and passes it on to the authoritative name servers for that zone.
