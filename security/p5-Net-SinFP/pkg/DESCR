SinFP uses the aforementioned limitations as a basis for tests to be
obsolutely avoided in used frames to identify accurately the remote operating
system. That is, it only requires one open TCP port, sends only fully standard
TCP packets, and limits the number of tests to 2 or 3 (with only 1 test giving
the OS reliably in most cases).
